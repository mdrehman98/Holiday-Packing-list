# Theory Question Answers

Q1) 
The application that i would create would be something that would bridge the gap between The current Education Systen and the Industry . The Current Education system is mainly focuses on theory and provides the very basic information of a particular area of learning, which when moved to an Industry enviornment doesnt come much of use. Many students struggle to learn anything important in their respective stream when coming to Industry standard Skills and most of them try learning on the Job.

How it would work:

The application would be powered by a massive dataset from multiple companies, companies which have industry level tasks that can be sourced to students.
Each student would need to complete a section of the education to access this project. Before accessing the project, there can be a small test with respect to what he learnt eliminating the rigorous process of exams towards the end.
Once the student passes, he can select the multiple projects which will be given directly by the clients of the company. This way , the universities will have an idea about what the student will need to learn in order to learn a skill that could be utilised at an industry level.

What it would look like: The System would be a web-based application that would be accessible to students,universities and companies. It would have a user-friendly interface that would allow students to easily track their progress and get feedback on their work. The application would also have a variety of features that would allow students to interact with the content, such as the ability to create and share notes, ask questions, and get help from teachers. It would be a means to connect the gap between students, universities and companies.

Q2)

The first thing I would do is to do my research on the feature that I need to implement. I would read documentation, search for tutorials, and ask questions on forums and communities. I would also try to understand the problem that the feature is trying to solve.
Once I have a good understanding of the feature, I would break it down into smaller tasks. This will make the task seem less daunting and it will help me to plan my work.
There are many different tools and libraries that can be used to implement features. I would need to find the right tools and libraries for the specific feature that I am implementing.
Once i have found the right tools and get a basic idea about the tech, i would start by implementing a small project to put my skills to the test and identify any problems am facing. This would sharpen my technology hold on the feature and would also help me learn and identify new things about it
Once I have a plan and the right tools, I can start coding. I would start by implementing the smallest tasks first and then work my way up to the more complex tasks.
Once I am satisfied with the feature, I would get feedback from other developers. This will help me to identify any problems with the feature and it will also help me to improve the feature.
